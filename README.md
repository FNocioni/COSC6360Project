Simulation of Byzantine Tolerance in Transaction Systems

In order to run this simulation, you must have a linux system (in order to support shared memory/semaphores).

With this simulation, you will have the ability to send queries and update values with transactions with the following syntax:

Search Data: "search [variable_name]"

Update Data: "set [variable_name] [value]"

To exit the simulation enter as input either: "end", "End", or "END".
